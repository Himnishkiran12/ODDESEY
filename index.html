        <h1>My preferred hobby<br><span id="break">Coding</span></h1>
        <p>I prefer coding since you can create many apps and websites through that. It's also very simple and easy to understand. You can also publish what you've made on the internet.</p>

        <h1>My preferred cartoon character<br><span id="break">Gumball</span></h1>
        <p>I mostly like Gumball because he's comedic. He's so comedic that he's become a meme just because of the faces that he makes. He always tries to hide his sister's smartness with his comedic personality and it ends hilariously.</p>

        <h1>My preferred vehicle<br><span id="break">Cars</span></h1>
        <p>I like cars because they're the of the fastest land vehicles in the world. They're also many styles you can possibly think for a vehicle. I personally like McLaren, Porche and Chevorlet.</p>

        <h1>My preferred subject<br><span id="break">Science</span></h1>
        <p>I prefer science because you can learn things as small as a quark to things as large as the universe. One of the main things I like about science is doing expirements on things.</p>

        <h1>My preferred color<br><span id="break">Vermillion</span></h1>
        <p>It's a bright color and is used by many people. I like it because it's a type of red which explains the background i'm using for this website right now. Also the color looks like ketchup. My family also uses this in poojas.</p>

        <h1>My preferred snack<br><span id="break">Pizza</span></h1>
        <p>I like pizza because it's yummy. It also comes in various forms. I personally like extra cheese and the last time I ate it was on my birthday, and I hadn't eaten pizza since 7-8 months before that.</p>

        <h1>My preferred toy<br><span id="break">Nerf</span></h1>
        <p>I like nerf blasters primatily because you can play with multiple people or by yourself. You can also practice aiming with it. There are many series of blasters each having their own colors and designs.</p>

        <h1>My preferred movie<br><span id="break">Apollo 13</span></h1>
        <p>I prefer apollo 13 since it depicts every single thing that happened correctly. All that happened in the movie actually happened in real life. It's great.</p>
